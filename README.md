# GolfBOT EV3 CDIO-62410
This project demonstrates a lego ev3 robot that can navgiate to and pickup table tennis balls, and deliver them to a goal. 
<br>Made using OpenCV, Numpy, Time, Socket, EV3, Flask, Threading, Traceback and Logging.<br>
<br>OpenCV.py works as the server. Main.py works as the client that handles requests from the server and sends requests to the EV3 robot.<br>
